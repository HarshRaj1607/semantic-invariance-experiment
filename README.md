# Semantic Invariance Experiment

This project explores whether semantic relationships remain stable across different embedding models.

## Idea
Different embedding models produce different vector representations.
This experiment checks if neighborhood structures and clusters remain consistent.

## Metrics
- Nearest Neighbor Overlap
- Cluster Consistency (ARI)

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python experiment.py

## Future Work
- Larger datasets
- Ensemble embeddings
- Rank-based invariance
